## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r eruptions, echo=FALSE}

library(leaflet)
selectInput(
  'breaks', label = 'Number of bins:',
  choices = c(names(providers))
)

renderLeaflet({
  leaflet() %>% 
    addProviderTiles(input$breaks) %>% 
    setView(-115,40, 4)
})

# renderPlot({
#   par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .5))
#   hist(
#     faithful$eruptions, as.numeric(input$breaks),
#     col = 'gray', border = 'white',
#     xlab = 'Duration (minutes)', main = ''
#   )
# })
```
